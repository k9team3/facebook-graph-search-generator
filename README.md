## What is Facebook Graph Search, and why does this project exist?
Facebook Graph Search is a powerful search engine that lets everyone play around with Facebooks "big data". It only shows you what is already accessible to you (at least that's what Facebook claims), but in a strctured and simple way that has been met by a lot of concerns about privacy. Especially since it can reveal things you might not think you had access to. This generator is simply just to give you some insight in what it's all about and some tips on the possibilities.

## Set the lanuage of your Facebook to English (US)
At the moment, Facebook Graph Search is only available for United States with English (US) language selected. However, anyone can change to English (US) by going to "Settings" -> "Language" in the upper right corner on Facebook. And search results will still show up from the entire Facebook database...

## Why not just type names directly in the search bar?
Well, a lot of stuff can have the same name. Everything on Facebook (people, places, events, etc.) have a unique ID, a so called UID. This is simply just a number, but very important to get the search accurate. And to get the UID for a person, use the persons unique username from the URL.
